# About the project
This is an exam project from the course, "(02462) Signals and Data" (Technical University of Denmark, 2021)

Our main task is to classify a movie's genre solely based on its plot (a little piece of text about the movie). 
We try to achieve this using pre-defined GloVe-embeddings; a method of embeddings the plot in a many-dimensional vector space. 
Assuming, that the plots of its own genre cluster together, we don't achieve a very good result. 
Using the FastText model, which is a more supervised approach, we got way better results, albeit we didn't have time to finish this part of the project before the deadline

We have gathered the result of our experiments in our project report, which had more information on the more theoretical part of the project. 
Showing this report is not possible due to the rules of DTU
